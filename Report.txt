We chose to create a graph that shows the impact that international travel can have on countries with different levels of covid infection. We did this by calculating and plotting the proportion of people infected each week in each country.

Initially we created variables that allow the user to input the initial proportion of the population that were infected in each country (PIx), the R value in each country (RVx), the rate of infection necessary to enforce a lockdown (PCL), the R value during a lockdown (RVL) and the number of weeks the graph will run over (weeks).

We created a function called infection_proportion with the purpose of calculating the rates of infection for each country each week. The function loops through for each week, taking a value for inf_x, the infection rate for each week for each country (x). It then adds that to a list of infection rates taken each week which are then shown on the graph.

The first part of the function checks the infection rate for week i to see if is greater than PCL, in which case the infection rate for week i is multiplied by RVL, otherwise it is multiplied by RVx, the normal R value for that country. 
We assumed that every person's infectiousness lasts a week, meaning that if they have covid one week, they will not have it when the proportion of infected people is calculated for the next week.
To show the impact international travel can have on infection rates we added various variables that decide both the start and end point for the plane journeys, as well as the number of flights (between 3 and 7 a day) that occur between the countries in that week. When a flight between two countries occurs, the infection rate of the start country is multiplied by the number of people in a plane and then divided by the total population of its destination. It is then added to the infection rate of the destination country for that week.
